            <h2>教育背景</h2>
            <p>Bachelor, Year of completion: 2025</p>
            <p>Xi’an Jiaotong University, Faculty of Electronic and Information Engineering</p>
            <p>Studying Computer Science in XJTU while focusing on working in AI and Bioinformatics.</p>
            <p>Major courses: Advanced Mathematics, Linear Algebra and Geometry, University Physics, Foundation of Life Science, Thinking of Big Data and Innovation, Data Structure and Algorithms, Discrete Mathematical Structures, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Introduction of Computer Systems (ICS), Probability Theory and Stochastic process, Bioinformatics, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Organization, Principles of Computer Networks, The Principle of Operating System</p>
        </section>

        <section id="publications">
            <h2>发表论文</h2>
            <p>Under Review</p>
            <p>One paper based on research 'Post-translation modification (PTM) prediction via deep learning' is submitted and under review.</p>
        </section>

            <h2>研究经历</h2>
            <h3>Internship</h3>
            <p>SenseTime, Year: 2023</p>
            <p>Helping on developing a smart sensor to monitor Alzheimer patients via CNN. The system is built on an embedding device, needing quantization from a Yolov5-based inference network. The first task is to identify faces, then face landmarks, then run signal processing algorithm to get signals like heart rates.</p>

            <h3>Intra-University Researches</h3>
            <p>Causal Prediction in microsatellite instability (MSI) and gene network, Year: 2022-</p>
            <p>Developed a toolbox on causal prediction between gene network and MSI. The tool is set by 3 stages: Stage I, filtering genes via correlation. Stage II, generate a causal graph via causal discovery algorithm. Stage III, checking the correctness and robustness via DoWhy package with causal inference algorithm.</p>

            <p>Monomer inference in fruit fly’s centromere, Year: 2024-</p>
            <p>Analysis of the structure in centromere of Drosophila melanogaster. The ‘atomic’ unit of centromere is ‘monomer’, which construct ‘HOR (higher-order repeat)s’ in special orders. HOR connects with each other in a ring to construct the centromere, and our work is to analyse the HORs and monomers from long-read gap-free sequence data.</p>

            <h3>Inter-University Researches</h3>
            <p>Post-translation modification (PTM) prediction via deep learning, Westlake University, Year: 2024-</p>
            <p>Building a deep learning framework, containing a majority of deep learning methods in PTM prediction, while also developing a novel method, combining sequence and structure data, attempting to reach SOTA in multi-class prediction. Besides, we produced a well-rounded dataset in PTM with both sequential and structural information. This work is under review.</p>

        <section id="awards">
            <h2>获奖情况</h2>
            <p>China National Biology Olympics (CNBO) Silver, Year: 2021</p>
            <p>Xi’an Gaoxin No.1 High school</p>
            <p>A Silver Medal in CNBO, China’s branch of IBO. During the preparation of the CNBO, a category of courses in biology is learned, see 'PROFESSIONAL SKILLS' to get the course list.</p>

            <p>International Genetic Machine Olympics (iGEM) Gold, Year: 2022-2023</p>
            <p>Xi’an Jiaotong University</p>
            <p>Being a member of iGEM team, working on Modelling branch, using cellular automata to model the population of cells and its secretion. The whole project is focused on building a light-induced autolysis on engineered bacteria to emerge genocides, while the cell lysis cycle controls the amount of genocides.</p>

            <p>China International College Students’ Innovation Campaign Honorable Mention, Year: 2022-2023</p>
            <p>Xi’an Jiaotong University</p>
            <p>The award is based on my research 'Causal Prediction in microsatellite instability (MSI) and gene network'</p>
