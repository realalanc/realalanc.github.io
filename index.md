## Research Experience

**Internship at SenseTime**  
Year: 2023  
Status: Finished
- Developed a smart sensor to monitor Alzheimer patients via CNN on an embedding device, involving quantization from a Yolov5-based inference network. Tasks included face identification, landmark detection, and signal processing for heart rate.

**Intra-University Research**
- **Causal Prediction in microsatellite instability (MSI) and gene network**  
  Year: 2022
  Status: Paused
  - Developed a toolbox for causal prediction between gene networks and MSI, involving correlation filtering, causal graph generation, and correctness checking via causal inference algorithms.

- **Monomer inference in fruit fly’s centromere**  
  Year: 2024
  Status: Processing, expected to submit in December 
  - Analyzed the structure of the centromere in Drosophila melanogaster, focusing on monomer analysis from long-read gap-free sequence data.

**Inter-University Research**
- **Post-translation modification(PTM) prediction via deep learning**  
  Westlake University, Year: 2024
  Status: Under **ICLR2025** review 
  - Developed a deep learning framework for PTM prediction, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art results in multi-class prediction using sequence and structural data.
  - Got 5.5 marks in Neurips2024, but rejected by AC.
- **Gene expression prediction in Mamba**  
  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Year: 2024
  Status: Cancelled
  - Trying to predict cis-acting elements by using Mamba that is capable to handle long sequences.
- **Protein dynamics generation model**  
  Westlake University, Year: 2024
  Status: Processing
  - The research objective is to develop a model that, by learning from the molecular structure, chemical properties of protein-ligand complexes, and short-term molecular dynamics trajectories (the first few frames), can predict and output longer-term molecular dynamics trajectories of protein-ligand complexes.
- **3D protein image structural embedding**  
  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Year: 2024
  Status: Processing
  - Training a embedding vector by VAE-like models, and providing it for downstream tasks like atom prediction.
- **Breast Cancer Medecal Image Dataset in Rare Classes**  
  Peiking University, Year: 2024
  Status: Processing
  - Developing a medical image dataset, including different types of medical images in different types of breast cancers. Focusing on rare cases, our dataset tends to provide a competative dataset and benchmarks for future downstream tasts.

## Awards

- **China National Biology Olympics (CNBO) Silver**  
  Year: 2021  
  - Awarded a Silver Medal in CNBO for proficiency in biology.

- **International Genetic Machine Olympics (iGEM) Gold**  
  Year: 2022-2023  
  - Awarded Gold as a member of the iGEM team for innovative work on cellular automata modeling.
  - The whole project is focused on building a light-induced autolysis on engineered bacteria to emerge genocides,
 while the cell lysis cycle controls the amount of genocides.

- **China International College Students’ Innovation Campaign Honorable Mention**  
  Year: 2022-2023  
  - Received Honorable Mention for research on causal prediction in microsatellite instability and gene networks.
