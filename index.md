## Research Experience

**Internship at SenseTime**  
Year: 2023  
Status: Finished
- Developed a smart sensor to monitor Alzheimer patients via CNN on an embedding device, involving quantization from a Yolov5-based inference network. Tasks included face identification, landmark detection, and signal processing for heart rate.

**First-author-level works**
- **MeToken: Uniform Micro-environment Token Boosts Post-Translational Modification Prediction**  
  Westlake University, with Cheng Tan [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6kTV6aMAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) and Stan Z.Li [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Y-nyLGIAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) Year: 2024
  Status: Under **ICLR2025** review 
  - Developed a deep learning framework for PTM prediction, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art results in multi-class prediction using sequence and structural data.
  - Our model is based on VQ-VAE, which constructs graphs by capturing sequence neighbors and structural neighbors. It is divided into two tasks: pre-training the VQ-VAE and extracting intermediate embeddings for downstream tasks.
  - Got 5.5 marks in Neurips2024, but rejected by AC.
    
- **Protein dynamics generation model**  
  Westlake University, with Cheng Tan [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6kTV6aMAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) and Stan Z.Li [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Y-nyLGIAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) Year: 2024
  Status: Processing
  - The research objective is to develop a model that, by learning from the molecular structure, chemical properties of protein-ligand complexes, and short-term molecular dynamics trajectories (the first few frames), can predict and output longer-term molecular dynamics trajectories of protein-ligand complexes.

- **Data refine in protein prediction databasel**  
  Westlake University, with Cheng Tan [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6kTV6aMAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) and Stan Z.Li [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Y-nyLGIAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) Year: 2024
  Status: Processing
  - As can be known, protein prediction data often has biases against the ground truth. Our task is to build an algorithm to pair-to-pair refine and enhance the dataset.
    
- **3D protein image structural embedding**  
  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, with Wenhao Zheng[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=WpTE3MIAAAAJ) and Huaxiu Yao [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=A20BZnQAAAAJ) Year: 2024
  Status: Processing
  - Training a embedding vector by VAE-like models, and providing it for downstream tasks like atom prediction.

- **Rare cell identification via LLM**  
  Year: 2024
  Status: Processing
  - Using LLM as an extractor to identify rare cells from data, which can be used in different biological domains.

- **Causal Prediction in microsatellite instability (MSI) and gene network**  
  Xi'an Jiaotong University, with Xiaofei Yang [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=dztQpOgAAAAJ) and Kai Ye [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=ZANw36QAAAAJ) Year: 2022
