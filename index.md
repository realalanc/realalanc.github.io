## Research Experience

**Internship at SenseTime**  
Year: 2023  
Status: Finished
- Developed a smart sensor to monitor Alzheimer patients via CNN on an embedding device, involving quantization from a Yolov5-based inference network. Tasks included face identification, landmark detection, and signal processing for heart rate.

**First-author-level works**
- **MeToken: Uniform Micro-environment Token Boosts Post-Translational Modification Prediction**  
  With Cheng Tan [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6kTV6aMAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) and Stan Z.Li [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Y-nyLGIAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) Year: 2024
  Status: Accepted by **ICLR2025**
  - Developed a deep learning framework for PTM prediction, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art results in multi-class prediction using sequence and structural data.
  - Our model is based on VQ-VAE, which constructs graphs by capturing sequence neighbors and structural neighbors. It is divided into two tasks: pre-training the VQ-VAE and extracting intermediate embeddings for downstream tasks.
    

- **AlphaFold Database Debiasing for Robust Inverse Folding**  
  With Cheng Tan [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6kTV6aMAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) and Stan Z.Li [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Y-nyLGIAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) Year: 2024
  Status: Under Review
  - As can be known, protein prediction data often has biases against the ground truth. Our task is to build an algorithm to pair-to-pair refine and enhance the dataset.

- **How Effective is In-Context Learning with Large Language Models for Rare Cell Identification in Single-Cell Expression Data?**  
  Year: 2024
  Status: Accepted by **ICDM2025**
  - Using LLM as an extractor to identify rare cells from data, which can be used in different biological domains. We found that cross-query based in-context learning provides stable performance, independent of the data size, and achieves SOTA on some datasets.

- **A Chain-of-thought Reasoning Breast Ultrasound Dataset Covering All Histopathology Categories**  
  Year: 2024
  Status: Under Review
  - Developing a medical image dataset, including different types of medical images in different types of breast cancers. Focusing on rare cases, our dataset tends to provide a competative dataset and benchmarks for future downstream tasts.
  - Using CoT technique as a tool enhancing the explanibility and trustworthy of AI diagnose also reaching the SOTA performance.
    
**Other works**
- **Monomer inference in fruit fly’s centromere**  
  Year: 2023
  Status: Under Review
  - Analyzed the structure of the centromere in Drosophila melanogaster, focusing on monomer analysis from long-read gap-free sequence data.
    
## Awards
- **International Genetic Machine Olympics (iGEM) Gold**  
  Year: 2022-2023  
  - Awarded Gold as a member of the iGEM team for innovative work on cellular automata modeling.
  - The whole project is focused on building a light-induced autolysis on engineered bacteria to emerge genocides,
 while the cell lysis cycle controls the amount of genocides.

- **China National Biology Olympics (CNBO) Silver**  
  Year: 2020  
  - Awarded a Silver Medal in CNBO for proficiency in biology.




## Other Contributions

- **Building py-Cicero as a free open-source developer**  
  - Developing a Python-version Cicero software for calculating single-cell chromatin co-accessibility.
